The react app for the school and student to access 

React Assignment

In this assignment, we want to create a basic react app that mocks backend calls.

For the purpose of this assignment you are required to use:
React for the frontend
Backend - calls can be mocked by providing dummy values in react or a simple web server (having a backend web server is not the focus of this task so feel free to simply mock the values in react itself).
UI - this isn’t important and don’t focus too much time on this. We will have UI designers so for this assignment creating something very basic is sufficient. 

We want to create a small frontend application for a school that allows for the following functionalities:
Login as school admin/student/teacher
School admin
Create/edit/delete classes (Can mock the actual functionality, data can be dummy)
Create/edit/delete students (Can mock the actual functionality, data can be dummy)
Create/edit/delete teachers (Can mock the actual functionality, data can be dummy)
Assign students to classes and remove students from classes
Assign teachers to classes and remove students teachers from classes
Teacher
Can see the students in their class
Student
Can see the class they are in

We don’t need to have a working backend (although if you are able to get that, it’s a bonus). For the purposes of this assignment you can mock the backend API results to create a working react app.
